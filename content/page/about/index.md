Welcome to my blog, where I share my explorations of **Azure Cloud Services**, my research into **cryptocurrencies**, as well as various product recommendations and lessons learned from tech pitfalls.  
If you enjoy my content, feel free to buy me a coffee ☕ (◍˃ ᵕ ˂◍)

## About Me
My name is just a code name, but you can call me Lucas.

Interests:
- I love raising cats. I have three at home: two golden-shaded British Shorthair brothers and a blue-golden sister. The cover photo and site avatar feature my golden brother, Leon.
- I’m not a professional developer, but I quite enjoy tinkering with code.

## About This Blog
Most posts here will be presented in both Chinese and English, taking full advantage of Hugo’s multilingual capabilities. If you spot any typos, please don’t hesitate to let me know!

## How This Blog Was Built
This blog is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) + [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview). The theme is Jimmy Cai’s [Hugo-Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). You can follow the [Blogging with Hugo series](https://digitaldrummerj.me/series/blogging-with-hugo/) and the [Hugo-Stack documentation](https://stack.jimmycai.com/guide/) for theme setup. I think Hugo’s official tutorial can be a bit unfriendly for beginners—if something isn’t clear, a quick Google search usually does the trick.

For notes on customizing and beautifying the Stack theme, adding a comment section, and more, check out my [Hugo Stack Theme Customization]({{< ref "/post/building-a-personal-website/stack-theme-beauty" >}}).
