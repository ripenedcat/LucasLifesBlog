# Background
Although [Microsoftâ€™s documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo) on deploying Hugo sites to Azure Static Web Apps looks straightforward, following it as-is will cause your GitHub Actions build to fail with errors. The missing piece is the `app_build_command` setting in the workflow.

![Github Action failed](github-action-failed.png)

# Resolution
The cause is that Azure don't add `app_build_command` in the workflow, which makes the build fail. We will need to add `app_build_command: "hugo --gc --minify"` and everything will be fine. Here is the complete workflow content.
